Horizontal group - Analyzers

Stages: Worry & confusion, ambiguity & questions, defined-ness, prioritize, S.M.A.R.T goals
+ Worry & confusion
  + Stochastic processes and depth of statistical knowledge
  + How to communicate and coordinate among a group of 11 members
  + Replicating Ph.D.'s work with various models
+ Ambiguity & questions
  + What is analyzer role in the project
  + We understand workflow and library files, but what work does that entail exactly to get there
  + How many models are there (ETAS, poisson, simple Stark, etc.)
  + Understanding inputs and outputs of each of the models
  + Do 11 people all work on the analyzer role together, how do we break up the work
+ Defined-ness
  + Before and during Tuesday's class, we'll have defined roles for each person in the class, including analyzers
  + Break out into groups of 2-5 to work on select parts of the assignment, either across horizontals or amongst the analyzers
  + Be able to define and understand at a high level each of the models, how they differ
  + Understand how to communicate with the other horizontal groups in terms of passing along information
+ Prioritize
  + After Tuesday's class, will have prioritized tasks for each individual
+ S.M.A.R.T goals
  + After Tuesday's class, have come up with S.M.A.R.T goals for groups and individuals and have an understanding each Tuesday of what we're presenting the following Tuesday in class

Diagramming the Workflow (see diagram below)
+ Cloud of data from the real world
  + Data from <a href = "http://www.scec.org/">SCEC</a> (Southern California Earthquake Center)
  + Other earthquake data available to the public
+ Data curators
  + Will cache the data, will curate the data
  + Have a curated data in some format to pass along to analyzers
  + The data will contain columns of variables that the analyzers may want to use to analyze
+ Analyzers
  + For the models, ask: how many models (i.e. 3?), what is the name of the model (i.e. ETAS, simple Stark, poisson), what is the math / statistics behind it, what are the inputs, what are the outputs
  + For each model, understanding what the inputs and outputs are, bringing us closer to the defined-ness stage
  + The members of the analyzer group can split into groups of 2-4 to each focus on a different model, or a different part of the workflow, such as a few focus on ETAS, a few focus on simple Stark, a few are communicators with the neighboring data curators and visualizers to understand inputs / outputs between groups; this will be figured out before and during class on Tuesday
  + Analyzers should understand that output from data curators should be able to be used in any of the models that we choose (or after a bit more cleaning / analysis from our end), that our output from any model should be able to be used by the visualizers without much modification; any of the models that we use will likely ultimately come out with a single output to pass along to visualizers
+ Visualizers
  + Models (i.e. graph similar to curve in dissertation)
  + Other visualizations
+ Presenters
