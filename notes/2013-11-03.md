Office hour notes:
1) Talked to Aaron about Pandas syntax and taking data out of data frames 

2) Don't overthink, use the robotic process of trial and error and don't be afraid to make mistakes

3) Learned about tuples, data frames, and lists but didn't gain any ground on our datetime problem. For now
just use seconds as our unit.
