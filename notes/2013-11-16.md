M0: magnitude we predict

M1: smallest magnitude that will turn alarm on

set a level that won't turn on alarm until magnitude passes threshold

W(M:alpha) = (c1/m1)ku^M if m>m1
           
W(M:alpha) = 0 otherwise

vary M1 to sweep across alpha

idea is for lower levels of alpha the window is going to be smaller

u and c1 are two free parameters
