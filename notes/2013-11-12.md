Class notes:

Carl talked about his group's work on finding the optimal point at which the MDA model maximizes earthquake 
catches and minimizing alarm times at a value of Mu = .58


David presented on what constitutes and earthquake and how we can define one. His presentation can be found on his github.
Link will be updated later.

Chris talked about the MDA model (again for those who were still confused on what the MDA model does) and
talked about how the MDA model is more about an optimization problem rather than a seismologic problem. The constant
k in w(M) = ku^M is important and should be adjusted for when computing optimal earthquake catches within an alarm time.


Question session with Chris and Christina to find out what are the major questions to ask Luen and Stark when one of them
comes in on Thursday to clarify pressing issues.
