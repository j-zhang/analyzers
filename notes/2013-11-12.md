Class notes:

Carl talked about his group's work on finding the optimal point at which the MDA model maximizes earthquake 
catches and minimizing alarm times at a value of Mu = .58


David presented on what constitutes and earthquake and how we can define one

Chris talked about the MDA model (again for those who were still confused on what the MDA model does) and
talked about how the MDA model is more about an optimization problem rather than a seismologic problem. The constant
k in w(M) = ku^M is important and should be adjusted for when computing optimal earthquake catches within an alarm time.
